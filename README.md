This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

In addition, a couple of library worth mentioning include formik, yup and styled-components to complete the task. That would look overcomplicated for a simple task, but I will assume the goal is solve a simple problem using production code quality. 

## A few note
- I have added a placeholder to input field. I thought it was necessary. The aim was not to break the spec but fill in the technical gaps where the spec does not cover. 
- I have also added the styled-components directly within the component files with only one exception. This is because the component for this particular project are small sized and are more readable. Some however, prefer to have styled component on a seperate file. 

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm install`

To install packages

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.<br />
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.<br />
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.<br />
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.<br />
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.<br />
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can’t go back!**

If you aren’t satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you’re on your own.

You don’t have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn’t feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn’t be useful if you couldn’t customize it when you are ready for it.
